			<h5>SNOZ</h5>
			<p>Snoezelen rooms are interactive spaces for people with autism and other developmental disabilities, dementia or brain injury. Snoz has been designed for childs with muscular distrophy.

			<h5>ANTONYM</h5>
			<p>Creation of a brand for a new hotel in Barcelona. It is focused on people with creative profile and interested in culture. The concept design is based on paradoxes, because the target, defined as 'social eremits', tend to be solitary in terms of its creativity and curiosity. But what they really need is to meet people and share all this.</p>
